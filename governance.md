# Governance

## Units of organization

- *leader*: an elected individual who guides the team.
- *contributors*: active contributors to the project, those having more than
  5 PRs merged in the last year.
- *trustees*: a group elected by the *contributors* that provide
  strategic feedback.

## Overview

The scikit-image project is guided by a *leader*, whose
responsibilities include:

- Consulting with *contributors* to discover the best ways forward to
  improve and expand the project.
- Doing what she/he can to enable the community, helping them to
  perform at their best.
- Make the final call on community and technical decisions, in case
  consensus cannot be reached.
- Keep a watchful eye over discussions to make sure they happen in an
  inclusive, respectful and transparent manner.

The *leader* must be a person with *strong inter-personal as well as
technical abilities* and is elected once a year.  Candidates may be
nominated by anyone (including themselves), and provide a short
summary of their priorities for the coming year.  A closed ballot
election is held, coordinated by an external person—proposed by the
*contributors*—and unanimously approved by the *trustees*.

Once a year, the *leader* provides a concise report on the project
activities to the *trustees*, who meet to:

- Consider past performance and future directions with the express
  purpose of providing helpful criticism.
- Endorse the current *leader*.

## Conflict resolution

The *leader* has the final say in discussions, although this right
should only be invoked as a very last resort.  In general, the goal is
to have consensus of the entire community, or at least the
*contributors*.  It is the leader's responsibility to reasonably
pursue an amicable agreement.

When a leader behaves in a manner that threatens the project or
prevents it from moving forward, the *trustees* may unanimously decide
to call for an election, removing the *leader* with immediate effect.

## Replacement of trustees

If a *trustee* retires, a new *trustee* shall be elected by the *contributors*.
