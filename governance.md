# Governance

## Units of organization

- *leader*: an elected individual who guides the team.
- *contributors*: active contributors to the project, those having more than
  5 PRs merged in the last year.
- *trustees*: a group elected by the *contributors* that provide
  strategic feedback.

## Overview

The scikit-image project is guided by a *leader*, whose
responsibilities include:

- Consulting with *contributors* to discover the best ways forward to
  improve and expand the project.
- Doing what she/he can to enable the community, helping them to
  perform at their best.
- Make the final call on community and technical decisions, in case
  consensus cannot be reached.
- Keep a watchful eye over discussions to make sure they happen in an
  efficient, inclusive, respectful and transparent manner.

The *leader* must be a person with *strong inter-personal as well as
technical abilities* and is (re)elected once every two years.  Candidates may be
nominated by anyone (including themselves), and seconded by one contributor. For the election, they provide a short
summary of their priorities for the coming year.  A closed ballot
election is held, coordinated by a person who is not voting, who is proposed by the
*contributors*â€”and unanimously approved by the *trustees*.

Once a year, the *leader* provides a concise public "state of the project" report.

The *trustees* meet soon after the "state of the project" report to:

- Consider past performance and future directions with the express
  purpose of providing helpful criticism.
- Endorse the current *leader*.

## Conflict resolution

The *leader* has the final say in discussions, although this right
should only be invoked as a very last resort.  In general, the goal is
to have consensus of the entire community, or at least the
*contributors*.  It is the leader's responsibility to reasonably
pursue an amicable agreement.

When a *leader* behaves in a manner that threatens the project or
prevents it from moving forward, the *trustees* may, with a two-thirds majority, decide
to call for an election. In exceptional circumstances, the *trustees* may, on unanimous vote, suspend the *leader* with immediate effect, triggering an election.  At this stage, project decisions must be taken by full consensus of the *contributors* with the exception of the suspended *leader*.  The suspended *leader* may stand for re-election.

## Replacement of trustees

If a *trustee* retires, a new *trustee* shall be elected by the *contributors*.

The *contributors* may, in exceptional circumstances, offer a vote of no confidence in one or more *trustees*.  This must be proposed and seconded.  There must be a two thirds majority vote of the *contributors* to depose a *trustee*.
